= Modules



So far we have used the functionality which is available by default every time we start a new Nim file.
This can be extended with modules, which give more functionality for some specific topic.

Some of the most used Nim modules are:

* `strutils`: additional functionality when dealing with strings
* `sequtils`: additional functionality for sequences
* `math`: mathematical functions (logarithms, square roots, ...), trigonometry (sin, cos, ...)
* `times`: measure and deal with time

But there are many more, both in what's called the https://nim-lang.org/docs/lib.html[standard library] and in the https://nimble.directory/[nimble package manager].




== Importing a module

If we want to import a module and all of its functionality, all we have to do is put `import <moduleName>` in our file.
This is commonly done on the top of the file so we can easily see what our code uses.

[source]
.stringutils.nim
----
include::{source-dir}/stringutils.nim[]
----
<1> Importing https://nim-lang.org/docs/strutils.html[strutils].
<2> Using `split` from `strutils` module. It splits the string in a sequence of words.
<3> `toUpperAscii` converts all ASCII letters to uppercase.
<4> `repeat` is also from `strutils` module, and it repeats either a character or a whole string the requested amount of times.

[source, output]
----
@["My", "string", "with", "whitespace."]
MY STRING WITH WHITESPACE.
!!!!!
----

NOTE: To the users coming from other programming languages (especially Python), the way that imports work in Nim might seem "wrong". If that's the case, https://narimiran.github.io/2019/07/01/nim-import.html[this] is the recommended reading.

[source]
.maths.nim
----
include::{source-dir}/maths.nim[]
----
<1> Importing https://nim-lang.org/docs/math.html[math].
<2> Converting degrees to radians with `degToRad`.
<3> `sin` takes radians. We round (also from `math` module) the result to at most 2 decimal places. (Otherwise the result would be: 0.4999999999999999)
<4> Math module also has `^` operator for calculating powers of a number.

== Creating our own

Often times we have so much code in a project that it makes sense to split it into pieces that each does a certain thing.
If you create two files side by side in a folder, let's call them `firstFile.nim` and `secondFile.nim`, you can import one from the other as a module:

[source]
.firstFile.nim
----
proc plus*(a, b: int): int = <1>
  return a + b

proc minus(a, b: int): int = <2>
  return a - b
----
<1> Notice how the `plus` procedure now has an asterisk (`*`) after its name, this tells Nim that another file importing this one will be able to use this procedure.
<2> By contrast this will not be visible when importing this file.

[source]
.secondFile.nim
----
import firstFile          <1>

echo plus(5, 10)          <2>
echo minus(10, 5) # error <3>
----
<1> Here we import `firstFile.nim`. We don't need to put the `.nim` extension on here.
<2> This will work fine and output `15` as it's declared in `firstFile` and visible to us.
<3> However this will throw an error as the `minus` procedure is not visible since it doesn't have an asterisk behind it's name.


In case you have more than these two files, you might want to organize them in a subdirectory (or more than one subdirectory).
With the following directory structure:

[source, output]
----
.
├── myOtherSubdir
│   ├── fifthFile.nim
│   └── fourthFile.nim
├── mySubdir
│   └── thirdFile.nim
├── firstFile.nim
└── secondFile.nim
----

if you wanted to import all other files in your `secondFile.nim` this is how you would do it:

[source]
.secondFile.nim
----
import firstFile
import mySubdir/thirdFile
import myOtherSubdir / [fourthFile, fifthFile]
----
